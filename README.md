## 🛠 How It Works

* The app uses React state (`useState`) to manage notes.
* Notes are stored in an array and rendered using `.map()`.
* Each note has a delete button to remove it dynamically.
* Material-UI icons and components enhance the UI experience.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Future Enhancements

Here are some ideas for future improvements:

* ✨ Add **localStorage persistence** so notes aren’t lost on refresh
* 🖊️ Enable **edit note** functionality
